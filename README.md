# Authenticate 2025 Demo

This is a demo for my Authenticate 2025 presentation titled **Bound to Succeed: Cryptographic Security for Modern Sessions**. Attached
is the presentation in the `/docs` folder.

## Getting Started

First, install Docker and run the redis container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once you login, go ahead and start playing with what Browser Bound sessions with HTTP Message Signatures looks and feels like!
